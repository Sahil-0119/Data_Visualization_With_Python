# LAPD Crime Data Analysis Tool

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations on crime data from Los Angeles, spanning from 2020 to the present. The tool allows users to interactively explore crime trends, patterns by time and location, and the most common types of crimes reported.

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source**: [Crime Data from 2020 to Present](https://data.lacity.org/)

- **Columns Used**:
  - `Date Rptd`: Date the crime was reported
  - `TIME OCC`: Time of occurrence (HHMM format)
  - `Crm Cd Desc`: Description of the crime
  - `AREA NAME`: Name of the reporting LAPD area

> Make sure the dataset is downloaded and the path is correctly set in the script:
```python
DATA_PATH = "C:\\Users\\hp\\Downloads\\Crime_Data_from_2020_to_Present.csv"
